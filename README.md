# ⚡ Claude Artifact Runner

**The ultimate "Plug & Play" environment for running Claude AI's React code.**

> **Stop debugging. Start building.**

This repository is a pre-configured, professional development environment designed specifically for students and developers who want to run **React artifacts generated by Claude** immediately. It comes with the entire Shadcn UI library, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons pre-installed and wired up.

## 📖 Why Use This?
When you ask Claude to "Write a React Dashboard," it often gives you code that relies on 20+ different components (Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Tabs). If you try to run this in a standard React app, it will crash with "Missing Component" errors.

**This repo fixes that.**
* ✅ **Zero Setup:** React, Vite, and Tailwind are already configured.
* ✅ **Full Shadcn UI:** All 40+ components (Accordion, Dialog, Sheet, Table, etc.) are pre-installed.
* ✅ **Error-Free:** The configuration files (`vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`) are tuned to prevent common "PostCSS" and "ESLint" crashes.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This environment is built on the modern "Gold Standard" stack:
* **Framework:** React 18 + Vite (Blazing fast)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 (Stable & Reliable)
* **Components:** Shadcn UI (Radix Primitives)
* **Icons:** Lucide React



## 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1.  **Node.js** (Version 18 or higher) - [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)
2.  **Git** - [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/)
3.  **VS Code** (Recommended Editor) - [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)



## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Follow these 3 steps to get running in under 2 minutes.

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/najmularifeen786/claude-artifact-runner.git](https://github.com/najmularifeen786/claude-artifact-runner.git)
cd claude-artifact-runner
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
**Critical Step** This downloads the "engine" that powers the components.
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Start the Server
Turn on the local development server
```bash

## 💻 How to Use (The Workflow)
This repository is designed for a simple "Copy-Paste" workflow.

1. **Ask Claude:** Prompt Claude to build something (e.g., *"Create a Finance Dashboard using Shadcn UI and Tailwind"*).
2. **Copy Code:** Click the "Copy" button on Claude's code block.
3. **Paste:** Open `src/Artifact.jsx` in VS Code. Delete the existing code and paste Claude's code.
4. **View:** Check your browser. The UI will update instantly.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"I see a blank page or white buttons."**
* Did you run `npm install`? If not, stop the server and run it.
* Did you stop the server? Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal and run `npm run dev` again.

**"Port 5173 is already in use."**
* You might have another project running. Vite will automatically switch to port 5174. Just check the terminal link.

**"The import paths are wrong."**
* This repo uses standard imports. If Claude gives you code with `@/components/ui/...`, it will work automatically because we configured the path aliases for you.
